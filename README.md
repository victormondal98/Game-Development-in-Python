## Minesweeper in Python with Tkinter

**Introduction**

This repository contains the source code for a classic Minesweeper game developed in Python using the Tkinter library. 

**Features:**

* Classic Minesweeper gameplay with customizable grid size and difficulty levels.
* Visual representation of the game board with tiles and numbers indicating surrounding mines.
* Flag functionality to mark suspected mine locations.
* Game over detection on encountering a mine or successfully uncovering all safe tiles.
* (Optional) Timer to track elapsed game time.

**Development**

The game is built upon the Tkinter library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python. The code utilizes Tkinter widgets like buttons, labels, and grids to represent the game board, tiles, and other elements.

**Steps and Considerations:**

1. **Grid Creation:** Define the game board size (number of rows and columns) and populate it with tiles. Each tile can hold information such as its state (covered, flagged, revealed), surrounding mine count (if safe), or a mine itself.
2. **Tile Interaction:** Implement functionality for user interaction with the tiles. Clicking a covered tile reveals its content (number, mine, or empty space). Right-clicking a tile toggles a flag, indicating a suspected mine.
3. **Game Logic:** Update the surrounding tiles' revealed state when a safe tile is uncovered. Handle game over conditions - encountering a mine or successfully revealing all safe tiles.
4. **GUI Design:** Use Tkinter widgets to create the visual representation of the game board. This includes buttons for tiles, labels for displaying information (e.g., remaining flags, timer), and a visual indicator for flagged tiles.
5. **Difficulty Levels:** Implement different difficulty levels by adjusting the number of mines placed on the board relative to the board size.

**Key Notes:**

* Consider using object-oriented programming principles to structure the code (e.g., classes for Tile, Board, Game).
* Ensure proper handling of user input and game state updates.
* Implement clear and concise code with comments for better readability and maintainability.
* (Optional)  Add features like a timer for advanced players or a leaderboard to track high scores.

**Getting Started**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python (version 3 recommended) and the Tkinter library installed (`pip install tkinter`).
3. Open the main Python file (e.g., `minesweeper.py`) in your preferred IDE or text editor.
4. Run the script to launch the game.

**Additional Notes:**

* Feel free to modify the code to customize the game's appearance or add new features based on your preferences.
* Explore online resources and tutorials for further guidance on Tkinter game development.
